# Music Player Application

This project is a simple music player application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to play, pause, and navigate through a playlist of songs. The application features a user-friendly interface with playback controls, song information display, and volume control.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML document that contains the structure of the user interface.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that manages audio playback and updates the UI with song information.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that styles the music player application.
- `songs/`: A directory that holds the audio files (MP3) used in the application.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Ensure that the audio files are placed in the `songs` directory.
3. Open `index.html` in a web browser to run the music player application.

## Usage Guidelines

- Use the play button to start playback of the current song.
- Use the pause button to pause the playback.
- Navigate through the playlist using the previous and next buttons.
- Adjust the volume using the volume slider.
- The progress bar reflects the current playback position and can be used to seek to different parts of the song.
